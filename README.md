# SynthWithJUCE
University project - simple additive sound synthesis with JUCE.
It contains sine, sawtooth, triangular and rectangular wave generators, white and red noise generators, audio player, filters (EG and lowpass) and a simple 3D scene with spatial sound (last one written from scratch as JUCE doesn't support 3D sound, no stereo or doppler). 
All wrapped with a pretty GUI made with JUCE - zero command line interaction.
